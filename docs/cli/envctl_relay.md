## envctl relay

Relay server management

### Synopsis

Manage relay server connections for async sync with offline peers.

The relay acts as a store-and-forward mailbox - when peers are offline,
messages go to the relay; when they come online, they fetch pending messages.

Relay is configured per-project in the project chain using:
  envctl project relay set <url>

All messages sent via relay are end-to-end encrypted.

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for relay
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default $HOME/.config/envctl/config.toml)
      --lang string     language for messages (default: auto-detect)
  -v, --verbose         verbose output
```
