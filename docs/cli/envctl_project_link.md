## envctl project link

Link current directory to an existing project

### Synopsis

Create a .envctl/config file to associate this directory with a project.

Use this when you want to work with a project that was created elsewhere
or shared by a team member.

The project must exist in your local chains directory (from receiving
an invite or syncing).

Examples:
  envctl project link myproject
  envctl project link myproject   # in Bob's project directory

```
envctl project link <project-name> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for link
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    config file (default $HOME/.config/envctl/config.toml)
      --lang string      language for messages (default: auto-detect)
  -p, --project string   project name (overrides .envctl file)
  -v, --verbose          verbose output
```
