## envctl identity migrate

Migrate identity to YubiKey

### Synopsis

Migrate your software identity to a YubiKey for hardware-backed security.

This imports your existing signing key onto the YubiKey and generates a new
X25519 key for encryption (since ML-KEM is not supported on YubiKey).

Note: The key exchange key will be regenerated, so you may need to re-receive
secrets from peers after migration.

Examples:
  envctl identity migrate --yubikey

```
envctl identity migrate [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help      help for migrate
      --yubikey   migrate to YubiKey
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default $HOME/.config/envctl/config.toml)
      --lang string     language for messages (default: auto-detect)
  -v, --verbose         verbose output
```
