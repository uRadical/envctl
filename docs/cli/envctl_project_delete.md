## envctl project delete

Delete a project's local chain file

### Synopsis

Delete a project's local chain file.

This is a local-only operation that removes your copy of the project's chain.
Other project members still have their copies and can continue using the project.

Use this to clean up test projects or projects you no longer participate in.

Examples:
  envctl project delete testproject
  envctl project delete testproject --silent

```
envctl project delete <project-name> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help     help for delete
      --silent   delete without confirmation prompt
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    config file (default $HOME/.config/envctl/config.toml)
      --lang string      language for messages (default: auto-detect)
      --project string   project name (overrides .envctl file)
  -v, --verbose          verbose output
```
