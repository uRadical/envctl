## envctl project dissolve

Dissolve a project (requires admin consensus)

### Synopsis

Propose dissolution of a project.

This creates a dissolve block that must be approved by other admins
(if the project has multiple admins). Once applied, the project is permanently
dissolved and no new blocks can be added.

Dissolved projects:
- Cannot accept new blocks or proposals
- Cannot process env requests
- Remain visible in 'project list' marked as (dissolved)
- Can still be viewed for historical record
- Can be deleted locally with 'project delete'

This action cannot be undone.

Examples:
  envctl project dissolve myproject
  envctl project dissolve myproject --reason "Project completed"

```
envctl project dissolve <project-name> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help            help for dissolve
      --reason string   reason for dissolution
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --config string    config file (default $HOME/.config/envctl/config.toml)
      --lang string      language for messages (default: auto-detect)
  -p, --project string   project name (overrides .envctl file)

```
